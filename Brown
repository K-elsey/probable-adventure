On mobile so I’ll be concise. Me at climbing wall, bad tummy ache like trapper wind. Scared to guff as ladies present and it it felt like a hot one. Multiple times move to quiet area of climbing gym for people to come over. Thought fuck it I’ll go the bog for a sit down piss to fart. Wasn’t a fart. worst squits I can remember. Lucky escape as would have shat me briefs very publicly. - Woni; We had 1 pet as a kid, a hamster. My dad had to hit it with a hammer because vet bills cost too much when it was on its last legs. We had no more pets after that. - Freddukes Feb 26; Make Double D's Great again! iWingers Feb 26
